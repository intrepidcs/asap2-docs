A2L files are used by MCD systems and test tools like Vehicle Spy to translate ECU serial data into user friendly displays and dialogs to help with calibration and diagnostic development. Before using the A2L item area it is recommended to verify the Project Settings in the ASAP2 group on the main toolbar. The ASAP2 group also has tools for error checking, generating, and importing A2L files. The A2L item area contains tabs for different categories of items as shown in Figure 1. Click the hyperlinks above Figure 1 to find more information for each tab. Measurements - Characteristics - Axis Pts - Conversion Methods - Verbal Conversion Tables - Record Layouts - Groups Figure 1: Use the tabs in the A2L item area to view and edit items in A2L files. Table Features Shared Across All Tabs Every tab in the A2L item area shares useful features for working with their tables. Columns can be rearranged by dragging and dropping their headers within the table. Columns can also be added and removed. First, enable the Show Columns Customization checkbox to open a Hidden Columns window. Next, drag and drop columns between the table and the Hidden Columns window areas. Any columns dropped in the Hidden Columns window will be hidden after that window is closed. Columns can be filtered in two ways. First, text can be typed in the cells of the first row in the table marked with a funnel icon to find items containing that text. Second, if the mouse cursor hovers over a column header a funnel button will appear in the corner of the cell. Click the funnel button to open a list of predefined filters ready for selection. Columns can be sorted A-Z and Z-A by clicking the column header. A convenient right click menu is available if the mouse is right clicked while the cursor is hovering over the table area. Item colors in the table indicate various conditions:\\ Black - item is ok.Gray - item does not exist in the ECU map file loaded in the symbol tree.Orange - item has some other warning or error condition. Use the Build All tool on the main toolbar to quickly see the condition in the Messages area.","keywords":"A2L item area ASAP2 Editor edit A2L files A2L tabs measurement editing characteristic editing axis points column customization item filtering sorting A2L items","version":"Next"},{"title":"Record Layouts Tab","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/asap2/a2l-item-area/record-layouts-tab/","content":"Record Layouts Tab Record Layouts specify data structures in the ECU memory.

To create or edit Record Layouts in an A2L file use the Create or Edit tools from the Edit group in the main toolbar while the Record Layouts tab is active in the A2L file area. A dialog will open similar to that shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: The dialog for creating or editing A2L file Record Layouts. Refer to Table 1 below for a brief description of each property. Use the OK button to close the dialog and save any changes. Use the Cancel button to close the dialog without saving any changes. Table 1: Record Layout Properties​ Property\tDescriptionName\tUnique identifier of the Record Layout. Here are the main requirements for this field: Max overall length = 1024 characters. Max partial string length = 128 characters. Allowed characters: A - Z, a - z, 0 - 9, underscores, periods, and brackets [ ]. Must NOT contain spaces. First character must be a letter or an underscore. Any brackets must occur in pairs at the end of a partial string. Any bracket pairs must surround a number or string. Name is case sensitive. (i.e. &quot;b&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are considered unique) If in doubt about valid names, please refer to the ASAM specifications. Description\tComment or description. FNC_VALUES\tIf enabled, the Record Layout uses enabled properties to define how values are deposited in ECU memory. Position\tStart position of values in the record. If the Index Mode uses one of the Alternate options the position determines the ordering of values and axis points. Data Type\tNumber of bytes dedicated to each value and how those bytes are interpreted. UBYTE - 1 byte unsigned integer SBYTE - 1 byte signed integer UWORD - 2 byte unsigned integer SWORD - 2 byte signed integer ULONG - 4 byte unsigned integer SLONG - 4 byte signed integer FLOAT32_IEEE - 4 byte (32 bit) floating point IEEE format FLOAT64_IEEE - 8 byte (64 bit) floating point IEEE format Index Mode\tDetermines how the values of curves (arrays) or maps (tables) are stored in ECU memory. For example consider these 2 curves, a map, and an X-Axis: a1 a2 a3 == Example of curve a. b1 b2 b3 == Example of curve b with common X-axis. Y1 a11 a12 a13 == Example of map a with Y-Axis points. Y2 a21 a22 a23 X1 X2 X3 == X-Axis points common to examples above. COLUMN_DIR - store values by column. Applying this mode gives: Curve 'a' (a1, a2, a3) Map 'a' (a11, a21, a12, a22, a13, a23) ROW_DIR - store values by row. Applying this mode gives: Curve 'a' (a1, a2, a3) Map 'a' (a11, a12, a13, a21, a22, a23) ALTERNATE_WITH_X - store by alternating between column values and X-axis point. Applying this mode gives: Curve 'a' (a1, X1, a2, X2, a3, X3) Map 'a' (a11, a21, X1, a12, a22, X2, a13, a23, X3) ALTERNATE_WITH_Y - store by alternating between row values and Y-axis point. Applying this mode gives: Curve 'a' (not applicable) Map 'a' (a11, a12, a13, Y1, a21, a22, a23, Y2) ALTERNATE_CURVES - used for multiple curves with a common axis. Store by alternating between column values from each curve and the common X-axis point. Applying this mode gives: Curves 'a' and 'b' (a1, b1, X1, a2, b2, X2, a3, b3, X3) Map (not allowed) Address Type\tThere are 4 types of memory addressing: PBYTE - memory location has a 1 byte pointer to the value. PWORD - memory location has a 2 byte pointer to the value. PLONG - memory location has a 4 byte pointer to the value. DIRECT - memory location has the first value and remaining values follow with incrementing address. AXIS_PTS_X\tIf enabled, the Record Layout defines how X-axis points are deposited in ECU memory. Position\tSame description as above for the FNC_VALUES Position. Data Type\tSame description as above for the FNC_VALUES Data Type. Index Order\tDetermines the axis point sequence in the memory. INDEX_INCR - increasing index with increasing address. INDEX_DECR - decreasing index with increasing address. Address Type\tSame description as above for the FNC_VALUES Address Type.","keywords":"A2L Record Layouts ECU memory layout data structure mapping FNC_VALUES AXIS_PTS_X index mode address type memory pointers data types ASAM A2L editor","version":"Next"},{"title":"ASAP2 Editor Help Documentation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/asap2/","content":"","keywords":"ASAP2 Editor A2L file map file ECU calibration CCP XCP Vehicle Spy ICS software ASAM MCD-2MC A2ML diagnostics Intrepid Control Systems ECU tools memory edit protocol VSpy automotive calibration","version":"Next"},{"title":"Contact Information & Useful Links​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ASAP2 Editor Help Documentation","url":"/docs/asap2/#contact-information--useful-links","content":" ICS Contact Information  On the web:  Basic Training VideoAdvanced Training VideoASAM Standards ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Messages Area","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/asap2/messages-area/","content":"Messages Area The Messages area in the ASAP2 Editor displays any warnings or errors detected during the creation of an A2L file.
